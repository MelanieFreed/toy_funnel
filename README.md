# Purpose

This code generates simulated data of customers traveling through a funnel and then generates some simple statistics of the result. 


# How to run the code

1. Generate a Python 2 virtual environment

```
python -m virtualenv ENV
source ENV/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Edit config.py to change any values that you like.

3. Run the script

```
python toy_funnel.py
```

4. Look at the results in the file specified in the config.py file.  Any errors generated will be written to that file as well.
